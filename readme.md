1. Introduction

The Solar System 3D Visualization project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to explore the Solar System in a 3D environment. It is built using the Three.js library for rendering 3D graphics directly in the browser.
Users can observe the orbit of planets around the Sun, the self-rotation of each planet, lighting effects based on solar illumination, and interact with various user-controlled settings.


2. Project Overview

The project consists of a single HTML page that loads all required scripts and displays the 3D scene. The primary logic is written in a JavaScript module (`solarSystem.js`), which handles:

1.Scene and camera setup
2.Planet geometry and textures
3.Orbit and rotation logic
4.Interactive GUI controls
5.Responsive canvas layout

The project runs entirely on the client side and requires no backend.

3. Features

1.Realistic rendering of the Sun and 8 planets
2.Each planet spins on its own axis and orbits the Sun
3.Speed control sliders for orbit and spin of each planet
4.Toggle to show or hide orbit path rings
5.Lighting toggle to simulate real shadowing in space
6.Pause and resume animation with a button
7.Dark/light theme toggle
8.Tooltips showing planet names on hover
9.Fully responsive for all screen sizes
